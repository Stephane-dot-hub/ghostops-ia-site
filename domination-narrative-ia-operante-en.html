          In sensitive moments, it is not only decisions that matter, but the way they are told, repeated,
          distorted or appropriated. A dominant narrative always ends up structuring perception: it explains
          who is legitimate, who is “right”, who embodies the future or the problem.

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm md:text-base">
          GhostOps narrative dominance is about <span class="font-semibold">architecting this master storyline</span>,
          then deploying it as concrete sequences: public statements, visible acts, weak signals.
          Operational AI is used as a tactical tool: listening, generation, testing angles, simulating reactions,
          measuring impact, in order to adjust sequences in real time rather than steering by gut feeling.

          Four narrative dominance configurations
        </h2>

        <div class="space-y-6 text-sm">
          <!-- Case 1 -->
          <div class="bg-gray-800/70 rounded-xl p-5">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">Case #1 – Transformation perceived as pure “cost cutting”</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              A group launches a deep transformation of its operating model. Internally and externally,
              the narrative that takes hold is: “new wave of cost cutting”, whereas the real issue is the
              survival of the model over 5 years. Teams disengage, key talent leave, external relays
              align with this reading.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300">
              <span class="font-semibold">GhostOps intervention:</span> analysis of existing narratives
              (internal, unions, media, social networks). Construction of a legitimate master narrative
              (securing the future, preserving jobs, reallocating margins to innovation), declined per audience.
              AI-driven listening playbook: detection of what sticks, adjustment of angles and proofs.
              Result: the “cost-cutting” narrative remains present, but is challenged by a credible future-project
              narrative, strong enough to retain key profiles.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Case 2 -->
          <div class="bg-gray-800/70 rounded-xl p-5">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">Case #2 – Leader trapped in a permanent trial of intent</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              A leader appointed in a tense context is immediately caught in a trial of intent:
              “parachuted from HQ”, “too political”, “not from the field”. Every decision is read through this lens.
              Their authority no longer rests on their actions, but on a self-fulfilling negative reputation.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300">
              <span class="font-semibold">GhostOps intervention:</span> mapping implicit accusations
              and unspoken expectations. Definition of a programme of visible acts and targeted public statements,
              sequenced over time, supported by AI work on angles, clarity and coherence.
              Result: over the months, the leader’s figure is no longer defined only by the initial narrative;
              it is progressively re-defined by their decisions and concrete proofs of usefulness.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Case 3 -->
          <div class="bg-gray-800/70 rounded-xl p-5">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">Case #3 – Group under attack on its “ESG” legitimacy</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              An industrial group presents itself as committed on environmental and social issues.
              NGOs and internal collectives begin to denounce “ESG-washing”: some dossiers are unexplained,
              inconsistencies become visible. The “false virtue” narrative gains ground, including among internal talent.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300">
              <span class="font-semibold">GhostOps intervention:</span> lucid analysis of weak spots,
              clarification of what is truly solid and what is not yet. Construction of a narrative that does not
              overplay virtue, but owns trajectories, limits and trade-offs. AI playbook to test formulations,
              simulate critical reactions and prepare responses. Result: the group no longer presents itself as exemplary,
              but as engaged in a credible trajectory, consistent with its real industrial constraints.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Case 4 -->
          <div class="bg-gray-800/70 rounded-xl p-5">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">Case #4 – BU in narrative competition with another group entity</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              Two BUs or two countries are vying to be the group’s “showcase”. Each produces its own narrative,
              its numbers, its proofs. Internally, this creates ongoing competition, friction and misunderstanding.
              Externally, the group’s image becomes blurred.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300">
              <span class="font-semibold">GhostOps intervention:</span> clarification of what each entity
              really brings to the global narrative, definition of a group-level storyline that does not deny
              local specifics but articulates them. AI used to compare external perceptions of both narratives,
              identify redundancies and contradictions. Result: a group narrative that integrates, orders
              and prioritises local stories, instead of letting them compete permanently.
