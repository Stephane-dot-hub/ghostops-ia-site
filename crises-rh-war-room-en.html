          Beyond a certain threshold, an HR crisis is no longer a matter of “social climate”: it is a direct risk
          to business continuity, the valuation of a unit, or the credibility of a leader. When internal power games,
          social tensions and defensive legal reflexes stack on top of one another, classical tools (audits, coaching,
          internal communication) arrive too late or too weak.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm md:text-base">
          The GhostOps war room turns an unstable, fragmented and emotional situation into a steered trajectory.
          We organise decision-making, execution and exit, with a level of discretion compatible with high-stakes
          power, governance and reputation issues.

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              International industrial group, 420-person site in Western Europe. A transformation plan imposed
              by HQ (automation, reduction of temporary staff) is poorly relayed locally. The plant manager is
              challenged, the local HR is perceived as aligned “against the shopfloor”, and employee representative
              bodies (IRP) threaten to organise a highly visible action near a major customer site.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              The executive committee fears a domino effect: if this site tips over, two other fragile sites
              may follow. The subsidiary is at year-end, margins are under strong pressure.

              leadership / HR / employee representatives / line managers). Mapping of alliances and acceptable
              breaking points. Co-construction with the country MD of three realistic trajectories:
              maintaining the plant manager (with explicit support and repositioning), ordered transition with
              the appointment of a deputy manager from the field, or prepared exit with a controlled narrative.
              Scenario design for messages to IRP, shopfloor and group, sequenced over 60 days.
              Result: social movement avoided, managed transition, no significant external impact.

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              Growing mid-cap acquired by a listed group. The local HRD, historically very close to the founder,
              is caught between a corporate HQ pushing for rapid convergence of statuses and practices, and
              legacy managers experiencing the merger as a “takeover”.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              Rumours of restructuring and layoffs spread, mid-level talents (project managers, key account managers)
              quietly activate their networks. The first unplanned departures occur. Internally, the board starts
              questioning the deal.

              sequences (integration, guarantees, 18-month horizon). Implementation of short governance rituals
              and safeguards over 30–90 days. Result: talent leakage stopped, local HRD repositioned as a trusted
              relay rather than mere corporate executor.

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              In a strategic sales division, an employee reports potential moral harassment by a key manager
              with very strong business performance. Compliance and legal take over the case, but internal
              positions polarise quickly: some defend the “indispensable” manager, others consider the company
              cannot afford a public case.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              The CEO fears, on the one hand, media exposure, and on the other, a deep fracture within the sales
              team as a critical period approaches.

              rigorous handling of the report (in line with regulatory obligations), management of the manager’s
              presence or temporary stand-down, protection of the team and sensitive key accounts. Preparation
              of internal messaging (neither denial nor public trial), anticipation of different outcomes
              (confirmation, refutation, negotiated exit). Result: case handled in a secure framework, no internal
              or external runaway, business focus maintained.

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              B2B services group launching a multi-country digital transformation programme. Officially, everyone
              is aligned. In reality, a hard core of “informal leaders” within the operations teams slows execution:
              minimal adoption of new tools, sabotaged meetings, ambiguous messages to the teams.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              The programme sponsor reports to the board that “resistance to change” is underestimated. Project
              timelines explode, integrator invoices keep coming in, and the credibility of the programme erodes.

              repositioning and, where necessary, clean exits. Narrative alignment between sponsor, HR and field
              management. Result: programme brought back under control, blockages neutralised without political
