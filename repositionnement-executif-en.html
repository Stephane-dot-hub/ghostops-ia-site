          Beyond a certain level, a leader is not “sold”, they are <span class="font-semibold">positioned</span>.
          Their trajectory no longer depends only on performance, but on how they are perceived, interpreted

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm md:text-base">
          GhostOps executive repositioning is about regaining control over this perception:

          Four repositioning scenarios
        </h2>

        <div class="space-y-6 text-sm">
          <!-- Case 1 -->
          <div class="bg-gray-800/70 rounded-xl p-5">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">Case #1 – A “legacy” MD in a group changing cycle</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              A subsidiary of 1,200 people has been led for 8 years by an MD recognised for turning the
              business around. The group is changing cycle: increased pressure on growth, digital
              transformation requirements, new ESG expectations. Internally, the MD is perceived as “solid
              but out of step”. Emerging talent no longer see their future with them.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              Group CEO does not want to trigger social turmoil nor weaken a profitable entity,
              but can no longer defend status quo in front of the board.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300">
              <span class="font-semibold">GhostOps intervention:</span> discreet footprint (group CEO,
              group HRD, a few key relays in the subsidiary). Framing of options: repositioning the MD
              as a “transition orchestrator” over 18 months, pairing with a deputy MD from the next generation,
              or preparing an honourable exit with a valorising narrative. Construction of a storyline that
              turns a potential eviction into an orchestrated transition. Result: MD repositioned as conductor
              of the handover rather than “pushed out”, subsidiary stabilised, board reassured.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Case 2 -->
          <div class="bg-gray-800/70 rounded-xl p-5">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">Case #2 – A group CHRO turned silent scapegoat</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              In a listed group, the group CHRO has driven several heavy programmes (cost-cutting plans,
              social renegotiations, status harmonisation). Her internal image has drifted: perceived as
              “the executor of bad news”, she no longer manages to bring operational leaders on board
              for development topics.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              Officially, nobody is calling for her departure, but she is no longer brought into strategic
              topics – only into normative and disciplinary ones.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300">
              <span class="font-semibold">GhostOps intervention:</span> fine diagnosis of her real influence
              capital (where she still counts, where she is disqualified). Redefinition of a narrative
              oriented towards “building” (talent, future of work, leadership) and not only “constraint”.
              Scripting of targeted appearances (seminars, interventions with N-1s, CEO-sponsored dossiers).
              Result: progressive repositioning of the CHRO as strategic partner, without denying past decisions,
              but integrating them into a broader narrative arc.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Case 3 -->
          <div class="bg-gray-800/70 rounded-xl p-5">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">Case #3 – A European Sales Director who has become “too expensive” politically</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              European Sales Director of a B2B division, highly performant on numbers but perceived as
              “individualistic” and “unmanageable”. He has direct access to several key accounts,
              sometimes bypasses reporting lines, and does not hesitate to challenge decisions in ExCom.
              His business value is high, but his political tolerance is decreasing.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              The CEO hesitates: keeping him as is undermines ExCom cohesion, pushing him out weakens
              critical revenue and could send a dangerous message to the market.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300">
              <span class="font-semibold">GhostOps intervention:</span> confidential work on three options:
              refocusing the director on a strategic client portfolio with a clear mandate, repositioning
              him as a transverse “deal maker” with guardrails, or a negotiated exit with a targeted consulting
              contract. Reframing the internal narrative (“indispensable but undisciplined” → “specialist activated
              where it makes sense”). Result: coherent trajectory, reduced risk of public clash, preservation
              of revenue on key accounts.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Case 4 -->
          <div class="bg-gray-800/70 rounded-xl p-5">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">Case #4 – A high-potential female leader misaligned with the timing</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              An Operations Director, 42, promoted internally, is objectively one of the strongest
              profiles of her generation. But she emerges at a time when local HQs are being simplified
              and the group favours highly international profiles for top roles.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
              Without clarification, she risks hitting a political ceiling, then leaving for a competitor –
              with the conviction she has been “blocked”.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300">
              <span class="font-semibold">GhostOps intervention:</span> definition with CEO and HRD of an explicit
              3–5 year trajectory (potential moves, international exposure, transition roles).
              Construction of a “leader in accelerated build-up” narrative, with chosen windows of appearance
              (cross-functional projects, special missions, visibility with the board).
              Result: retained talent, alignment between personal ambitions and the organisation’s real horizon,
              reduced silent frustration.
